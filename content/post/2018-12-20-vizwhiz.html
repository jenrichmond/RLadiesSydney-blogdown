<p>#RYouWithMe Unit 3 - VizW(h)iz</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-12-20-vizwhiz_files/VizWizBanner.jpg" /></p>
<p>Welcome to the third unit of <a href="/ryouwithme">RYouWithMe</a>! In Unit 3, we’re tackling data visualisation!</p>
<p>Unit 3 has five lessons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-1/">Plotting Raw Data</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-2/">Boxes, Violins, and Histograms</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-3/">Bars, Columns, and Scatterplots</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-4/">Customising Plots</a></li>
<li><a href="/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-5/">GIFS! A VizW(h)iz Bonus Lesson</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Plus, we’ve sourced some beautiful plots on quick demand from some <code>ggplot</code> pros. (pros relative to us, at least!) Check out the plots and their RMD files at the <a href="/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-gallery/">VizW(h)iz Gallery</a></p>
<p>#Why “VizW(h)iz”?</p>
<p>R-Ladies Sydney co-founders Lisa Williams and Jen Richmond, who conjured up the name of this unit, had different things in mind! Lisa had in mind “VizWiz” - as in Visualisation Wizardry! Jen had in mind “VizWhiz” - as in Becoming a Whiz in Visualisation!</p>
<p>It turns out this debate cannot be won (or lost). True, wizards are classically male - though we’re all about busting stereotypes at R-Ladies Sydney! Also true - while it’s great to be a whiz at something, we all know by know learning R isn’t such a speedy undertaking!</p>
<p>To bridge this great divide, we find ourselves with a compromise: VizW(h)iz!!</p>

#RYouWithMe Unit 3 - VizW(h)iz


![](/post/2018-12-20-vizwhiz_files/VizWizBanner.jpg)

Welcome to the third unit of [RYouWithMe](/ryouwithme)! In Unit 3, we’re tackling data visualisation! 

Unit 3 has five lessons:  

1. [Plotting Raw Data](/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-1/)
2. [Boxes, Violins, and Histograms](/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-2/)
3. [Bars, Columns, and Scatterplots](/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-3/)
4. [Customising Plots](/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-4/)
5. [GIFS! A VizW(h)iz Bonus Lesson](/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-5/)

Plus, we’ve sourced some beautiful plots on quick demand from some `ggplot` pros. (pros relative to us, at least!) Check out the plots and their RMD files at the [VizW(h)iz Gallery](/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz-gallery/)

#Why "VizW(h)iz"?

R-Ladies Sydney co-founders Lisa Williams and Jen Richmond, who conjured up the name of this unit, had different things in mind! Lisa had in mind "VizWiz" - as in Visualisation Wizardry! Jen had in mind "VizWhiz" - as in Becoming a Whiz in Visualisation! 

It turns out this debate cannot be won (or lost). True, wizards are classically male - though we're all about busting stereotypes at R-Ladies Sydney! Also true - while it's great to be a whiz at something, we all know by know learning R isn't such a speedy undertaking!

To bridge this great divide, we find ourselves with a compromise: VizW(h)iz!!
